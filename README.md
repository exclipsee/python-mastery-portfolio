# python-mastery-portfolio

Hey — I'm a freelance dev. This repo is a grab-bag of small, useful Python
tools and demos I use in interviews and toy projects. It's practical, simple,
and ready to play with.

What you'll find:

- Small utilities (VIN tools, algorithms)
- Tiny ML helpers (train/predict demo)
- A simple FastAPI demo and a CLI
- Tests and a couple of tiny benchmarks
